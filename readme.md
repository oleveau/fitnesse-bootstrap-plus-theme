## Bootstrap-plus FitNesse Theme
This is a FitNesse Theme that extends the default bootstrap theme for better usability.
Uses Bootstrap 4.4, JQuery 3.4 and CodeMirror 5.52

### Features:
* Improved styling for better readability and information density
* Light and dark version of the theme for the wiki and CodeMirror editor
* Different favicons for Tests, Suites, Static pages and Edit mode
* Show the page name first in the page title (So different tabs have recognizable titles)
* Optional sidebar to ease navigation
* Visual identification of slim tables using icons
* Failure navigator highlights current failure, eliminates scrolling - jumps to next
* Adds a 'Recent pages' overview to the end of the frontpage
* Optional maven version checker that shows current dependency versions and compares them to the latest version in maven central
* Icons in Table of contents to distinguish between Tests, Suites and Static pages
* Suites now have a 'run tags' input field in the navigation bar, so all tests containing any of the specified tags in this input field can be run immediately
* If Autocomplete responder is also installed, ctrl-space suggestions are context-aware:
  * All fixture methods available in the current test
  * All scenario's from include ScenarioLibraries
  * All slim symbols set by `$varName=` that are available
  * NOTE: If you want context-aware autosuggest in ScenarioLibraries, make sure to edit them from an edit link on a *test-page*. The hint-script will then use the referring page as context
* Context-help pane containing all fixtures, methods, scenario's, slim symbols in current test scope
* Jump to definition for fixture methods and scenario's by pressing ctrl-comma in the editor, revealing candidates in the context-help pane
* validation of wiki tables against current context and basic syntax (aimed at slim usage). Use validate button,auto validate on save option or ctrl-dot.
* Insert scenario's and fixture methods in the editor by clicking the plus-icon in the context pane
* Experimental: Autosave and validate test pages on enter
